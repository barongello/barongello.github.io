## <a id="programming-languages"></a>Programming languages

To be honest: I am a coder, period

I don't stick to a programming language so hard and I am versatile enough to keep going back and forth between them without problems. Also I am a fast learner

Went through many and many languages over the years. Some more deeply, some superficially, some used at works, some used at hobbies. Every single one has its time and place

I am not an wandering encyclopedia and I often read their documentations. Also I am not afraid or ashamed of asking things for others or searching around the web (nowadays we have plenty of good technical subjects sources)

If it is a matter of the ones I love more, they are, to name a few:
  - C
  - Rust
  - C++
  - Assembly
  - JavaScript

This portfolio only contains some of the digital educational projects I made over the years. They were intended to run in very low end tablets that government distributed to public schools

They can be found <a href="https://barongello.com.br/portifolio" target="_blank">here</a>

Note: they are in portuguese

You can find a few more projects on my GitHub pages (<a href="https://github.com/barongello" target="_blank">Barongello</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SultansOfCode" target="_blank">SultansOfCode</a>)

## <a id="background"></a>Background

Amused by games since my childhood, got a computer as gift in 1997, where I immediately started to learn coding to develop my own games

My first contact with cheating was with the game Elifoot, where we could use Cheat-O'Matic to modify in-game values. Was love at first sight: how can a process modify things in another process?

Also, living in a 3rd world country, where things were always expensive, I used to buy bootleg discs and I found magic that they have a little piece of software included that would register the application as if it was original

Searching around I have found the marvelous world of cracking, which is also related to cheating. Made a few friends in the Brazilian scene and started my journey as a reverse engineer too

As a teenager, I often skipped classes in the technical college to spend time in the arcade houses nearby. Which quickly led me to know their owners and started to getting asked to crack some games, create hardware for them, create clones of the games and things like that

This is the closest I got from my dream of coding games. The next closest works were the digital educational projects that are in my [portfolio](#portfolio) and the lessons app that was part of the job I did at NUITEQ

For hobby I did a few emulators, small OS, a lot of cheats, everything to learn more even although the emulators were not capable of running a lot of games neither the OS were fully usable

Made some games with Klik & Play, Adobe Flash and RPG Maker. A few without engines, all by hand. More recently I was fiddling with Godot

Also did some foot switches for electric guitars, participated in Nintendo Wii homebrew scene, did a lot of ROM translations and ROM hacking

Did some jailbreak (software and hardware) in my consoles too, just for fun

Gave some lectures, workshops and webinars about reverse engineering and cheating

## <a id="fun-facts"></a>Fun facts

1. My last job I got in a very unusual way. I was applying to reversing's freelances in a website and someone wanted a protection break plus a full report on how it was done for a brand new multitouch application
&nbsp;
I did and, before delivering it, I contacted the company that developed the software to check it out, since it was kinda suspicious
&nbsp;
The CEO answered me that there was no one working for the company with that name and that the company requested nothing
&nbsp;
I replied that it was very unfortunate, since I have already done the job and now I was going to not be paid, since I would not deliver a crack
&nbsp;
Then he asked me to send it to him and he paid me. They improved their protections and asked me to break it again, which I did. Then we kept in touch for some years until he called me to work for them
